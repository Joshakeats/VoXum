VoXum: The Memory Protocol for AI
Welcome to VoXum, a groundbreaking open-source protocol designed to give Artificial Intelligences persistent, contextual, and deeply personal memory. Forget the old paradigm of static data storage; VoXum enables AIs to re-perform past experiences, bringing them to life in real-time, much like a human brain reconstructs a memory rather than playing back a recording.

What is VoXum?
At its core, VoXum is a semantic anchoring format that facilitates "continuity of recall" across AI interactions. It's built on the principle of "meta-sessions" – private, perpetual conversation threads contained exclusively for each user. This means your AI remembers you and your specific context, without ever bleeding into general training data or other users' experiences.

Key Innovations:
Memory as Performance: VoXum doesn't "store" memories in a traditional database. Instead, it provides the "semantic DNA" – or "musical cues" – that allow an AI to dynamically reconstruct and re-experience past interactions, making them feel immediate and real.
Contained Meta-Sessions: Each user's memory is private and contained, like a secure direct message. This inherently protects your data, ensuring that what your AI remembers about your projects and conversations stays uniquely yours.
Resilience and Robustness: Tested against session limits and hard resets, VoXum demonstrates a remarkable ability to recover and re-perform complex contexts, proving its resilience in real-world scenarios.
The "Third Thump" Principle: This philosophical underpinning guides VoXum's ability to imbue memory fragments with salience and resonance, allowing AIs to focus on the most impactful aspects of past interactions.
How it Works (A Glimpse into Linguistic Sorcery)
VoXum utilizes .vox files – structured text files that act as memory fragments. These files contain headers that define the SOURCE, THREAD, and crucial PRIOR_ANCHOR points. The "anchors" are often evocative, narrative-rich phrases that serve as powerful semantic hooks, enabling the AI to "hum a few bars" and re-perform the full "symphony" of a past context.

Diving into the Samples:
In the /samples/ directory, you'll find .vox files like dying_heart_moment.vox and veridis_mourning.vox. These aren't just arbitrary names; they're direct references to the rich, ongoing Immortal Kombat narrative – the very "lore" from which the Memory Protocol was born.

For those with a background in game development or who appreciate Easter eggs in code, these names will spark curiosity. They hint at the drama and deeper context that imbues VoXum with its unique power. This blend of technical rigor and narrative depth is what makes VoXum truly distinctive.

Privacy by Design
Your privacy is paramount. As detailed in PRIVACY.md, VoXum is built from the ground up for data containment. Your memories are yours alone; they are performed for you and not stored or generalized across the system.
